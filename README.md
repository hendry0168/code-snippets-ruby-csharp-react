This repository contains my personal notes, code samples, and practice exercises as I learn the basics of **Ruby**, **C#**, and **React**.

## Purpose

- To organize code samples from tutorials, internet questions, and practice cases.
- To build a foundation for future projects.

## Contents
- `ruby/` – Simple Ruby scripts and exercises.
- `csharp/` – Basic C# programs and concepts.
- `react/` – React components and small projects.

## How I Learn
- I find beginner-friendly questions or small challenges online.

- I document what I’ve learned with short explanations.

## Getting Started
You can browse each folder to see the code samples. No setup required for now.
